     In my experience of running this program, I saw that linear search time complexity is less than binary search time. In order to use binary search, we need to sort the array first and then check the middle element.If the value is bigger than what we are looking for, then we look in the first half; otherwise, we look in the second half until desired element is found. But linear search does not need to sort any array. It works by looking at each element in a list of data until it either finds the element or reaches the end. If the list of data is already sorted, then the binary search has an advantage over linear search since the search complexity is reduced, meaning O(log n) will be less than O(n). We know that the worst case running time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log N) and linear search algorithm is O(n). I would rather use binary search if we have 100 elements to search since binary search can only take ten steps but linear search can take 100 steps.
